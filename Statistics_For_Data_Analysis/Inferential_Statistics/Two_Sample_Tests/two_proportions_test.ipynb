    "## Take samples from two populations and determine if the populations are similar or not with regards to some proportionality. i.e. the proportionality stems from a true/false relation imposed on the populations. e.g. take a sample from two towns of people and compare the proportion of smokers to non-smokers. Again as with the one proportion test we require at least 10 successes and 10 failures. The binomial distribution is used for the numeric test, though the binomial distribution is difficult to work with so a normal approximation can again be used. In terms of a hypothesis test:\r\n",
